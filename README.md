The main goal of this specialization is to provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary to develop a strong foundation on core paradigms and algorithms of machine learning (ML), with a particular focus on applications of ML to various practical problems in Finance.

The specialization aims at helping students to be able to solve practical ML-amenable problems that they may encounter in real life that include:

(1) mapping the problem on a general landscape of available ML methods,

(2) choosing particular ML approach(es) that would be most appropriate for resolving the problem, and

(3) successfully implementing a solution, and assessing its performance.
